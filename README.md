# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-VIA-DEEP-LEARNING
Employed Artificial Neural network and Convolution Neural Netwrok on CIFAR-10 Dataset.
CIFAR-10 has 10 classes and CNN classified images with better accuracy than ANN. 

Estiblished classification on Fashion_Mnist dataset of 10 classes and applied both ANN and CNN.

Accomplished image classification on Mnist dataset for digit classification of 10 classes[0-9].
Tried different optimizer during model compilation. Drawn confusion matrix of prediction and Truth.
